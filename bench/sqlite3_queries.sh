# Runs a query through two `.iyimod` boundaries, one of them a driver.
#
# `bench/kemal_serves.sh` and `bench/jwt_signs.sh` prove two kinds of shard
# cross. This proves a third, and the difference is why all three are here:
# `db` and `sqlite3` are a *pair*. `db` declares what a driver must answer and
# never sees one; `sqlite3` answers it and never sees `db`'s source. Every
# `abstract def` in between is a place where the producer compiled a body
# against nothing at all, and the consumer has to compile its own — which is
# the finding this gate holds down. `db`'s
# `Connection#fetch_or_build_prepared_statement` calls an abstract
# `build_prepared_statement`; the copy in `db`'s artifact returns its own
# argument, because in `db`'s build nothing answers it. Linked over the
# consumer's copy it handed back a statement whose `crystal_type_id` was 1.
#
#     bash bench/sqlite3_queries.sh
#
# Needs `make`, `shards`, the network and libsqlite3. Both shards are pinned.
#
# Exits non-zero if any bind or fill fails, if either arm fails to build, or if
# the two answer differently. The rows are the measurement: a boundary that
# lost a bound parameter or read a column at the wrong offset does not crash,
# it answers something else.

# `sqlite3`'s own README uses. Each connection to `:memory:` is its own
# database, so every statement here has to land on the *same* one — the pool
# has to get its connection back. That took `Pool#checkout`'s
# `res.responds_to?(:before_checkout)` finding a hook that is `protected` and
# reached through a type parameter, which the private-callee search could not
# see: without it `auto_release` is never set, nothing returns to the pool, and
# the table is gone by the next statement. A file-backed database does not
# notice any of that, which is exactly why this one is not file-backed.
