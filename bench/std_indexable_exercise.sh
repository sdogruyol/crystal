# Exercises the Indexable trait and proves its checks can fail.

#   bash bench/std_indexable_exercise.sh
#
# Verifies:
#   1. Complete Indexable surface on prelude Array(T) and MinimalSeq(T).
#   2. MinimalSeq implements ONLY size and unsafe_fetch, receiving Indexable
#      defaults and satisfying Enumerable without defining def each.
#   3. Negative index resolution wraps from the end (e.g. a[-1]).
#   4. Out-of-bounds positive and negative indexing raises.
#   5. Empty collection handling for boundary methods.
#   6. Release build with optimizations.
#   7. Failure proofs using patched copies via IYI_PATH.
#
# Exits non-zero if any check fails.
