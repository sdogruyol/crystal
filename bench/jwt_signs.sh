# `bench/kemal_serves.sh` proves a kemal application crosses. This proves a
# different *kind* of shard does, and the difference is the point of having
# both. kemal reaches nothing outside Crystal's own library; `jwt` reaches
# OpenSSL through a reopened `lib`, and under it `bindata` writes classes with
# macros that write classes — each subclass getting its own copy of a class
# variable its superclass declared — and hangs an exception hierarchy off
# `Exception`. Every one of those broke separately here: a `fun` a travelling
# body calls, a `lib` constant, a class variable four subclasses share the name
# of, a `to_s` a consumer reaches through a class held virtually.
#
#     bash bench/jwt_signs.sh
#
# Needs `make`, `shards` and the network. Both shards are pinned, so what it
# fetches is one version rather than whatever is current.
#
# Exits non-zero if any bind or fill fails, if either arm fails to build, or if
# the two answer differently. Answering differently is the failure worth
# naming: a token is a signature over bytes, so a boundary that dropped a field
# or numbered a type differently does not crash, it signs something else.
