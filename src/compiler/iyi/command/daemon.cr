# A build daemon: analyse the prelude once, then fork a child per build so each
# build starts from a `Program` that already has it.
#
# The measurements behind this are in SPEC.md IV.1a/IV.1b. The prelude is ~87% of
# a small build's front end, and a fork restores it in about a millisecond, which
# is a floor no serialised artifact can beat. So the daemon is not a substitute
# for `.iyimod` — it cannot cross machines or sessions, and it is not the basis
# of separate compilation — but it delivers the same front-end win today.
#
# The output of a build has to reach the client as it happens, with `stdout` and
# `stderr` still distinguishable and the exit status intact. The child therefore
# writes to a pair of pipes rather than to the connection, and the daemon frames
# what it reads:
#
#     1 byte kind, 0 = exit, 1 = stdout, 2 = stderr
#     4 bytes little-endian length (or the exit code, for kind 0)
#     that many bytes
#
# Requests are a little-endian length followed by that many bytes of JSON,
# `{"cwd": ..., "args": [...], "version": ...}`. The version is checked, along
# with the server's own executable, so that a rebuilt compiler cannot be served
# from silently.

        from another:

            #{Command.program_name} daemon start
            #{Command.program_name} daemon build hello.iyi

            start (default)      run the daemon in the foreground
            build                send a build to a running daemon
